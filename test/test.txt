Dear All,

This is to inform you that our company is planning a get together on 11th April, Saturday, at 1100 hours at Golden Beach Resorts.  You may bring your spouses and children.

This get together will give us all an opportunity to get to know each other better and interact on a social basis.  It will prove to be the ideal getaway for the weekend, especially after such a hectic quarter.

I request you to kindly inform me about the number of family members who would be joining you, so that we can make suitable arrangements as regards to food and beverages.

The good news is that the drinks and food are on the house.

Regards,
Rohit Keshav
